	abstract = {INTRODUCTION We sought to develop a practical tool for predicting dementia risk among rural-dwelling Chinese older adults. METHODS This cohort study included 2220 rural older adults (age ≥ 65 years) who were dementia-free at baseline (2014) and were followed in 2018. Dementia was diagnosed following the DSM-IV criteria. The prediction model was constructed using Cox models. We used C-index and calibration plots to assess model performance, and the decision curve analysis (DCA) to assess clinical usefulness. RESULTS During the 4-year follow-up, 134 individuals were diagnosed with dementia. We identified age, education, self-rated AD8 score, marital status, and stroke for the prediction model, with the C-index being 0.79 (95\% confidence interval = 0.75–0.83) and the corrected C-index for internal validation being 0.79. Calibration plots showed good performance in predicting up to 4-year dementia risk and DCA indicated good clinical usefulness. DISCUSSION The 4-year dementia risk can be accurately predicted using five easily available predictors in a rural Chinese older population. Highlights We developed and internally validated a practical tool for dementia risk prediction among a rural older population in China. The prediction tool showed good discrimination and excellent calibration for predicting up to 4-year risk of dementia. The prediction tool can be used to identify individuals at a high risk for dementia for early preventive interventions.},

	abstract = {While many studies have explored the financial barriers to healthcare, there is little evidence regarding the non-financial barriers to healthcare. This study identified characteristics associated with financial and non-financial barriers to healthcare and quantified the effects of these characteristics in South Korea, using a nationally representative longitudinal survey dataset. Overall, 68,930 observations of 16,535 individuals aged 19 years and above were sampled from Korea Health Panel survey data (2014–2018). From self-reported information about respondents’ experiences of unmet healthcare needs, a trichotomous dependent variable—no barrier, non-financial barrier, and financial barrier—was derived. Sociodemographics, physical and health conditions were included as explanatory variables. The average adjusted probability (AAP) of experiencing each barrier was predicted using multivariable and panel multinomial logistic regression analyses. According to the results, the percentage of people experiencing non-financial barriers was much higher than that of people experiencing financial barriers in 2018 (9.6\% vs. 2.5\%). Women showed higher AAPs of experiencing both non-financial (9.9\% vs. 8.3\%) and financial barriers (3.6\% vs. 2.5\%) than men. Men living in the Seoul metropolitan area showed higher AAPs of experiencing non-financial (8.7\% vs. 8.0\%) and financial barriers (3.4\% vs. 2.1\%) than those living outside it. Household income showed no significant associations in the AAP of experiencing a non-financial barrier. People with a functional limitation exhibited a higher AAP of experiencing a non-financial barrier, for both men (17.8\% vs. 7.8\%) and women (17.4\% vs. 9.0\%), than those without it. In conclusion, people in South Korea, like those in most European countries, fail to meet their healthcare needs more often due to non-financial barriers than financial barriers. In addition, the characteristics associated with non-financial barriers to healthcare differed from those associated with financial barriers. This finding suggests that although financial barriers may be minimised through various policies, a considerable degree of unmet healthcare needs and disparity among individuals is very likely to persist due to non-financial barriers. Therefore, current universal health insurance systems need targeted policy instruments to minimise non-financial barriers to healthcare to ensure effective universal health coverage.},
